Find where to buy a macbook at the cheapest price

A simple python program to scrap the apple website in different countries and get the cheapest Macbook available in the world. This has been a fun exercise for me for learning how to use the BeautifulSoup library, the idea came reading one of my friends blog (http://blog.titocosta.com/post/111818247992/where-to-buy-your-macbook-pro)

Example:
python macbook-deal.py
